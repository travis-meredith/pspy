# PsPy
PsPy is a framework for adding behaviour to PowerShell via Python by allowing commands to be issued in PowerShell and executed in Python.

## Installation
Add `pspy/scripts` to path, set PATH in `ftscripts.py` to the directory of `pspy/`, and then run `python ./filetools.py` to generate initial PowerShell scripts.

## Samples
Sample scripts have been provided. These include Source Lines of Code (`sourcetools.py` or the command `sloc`) which prints out a sum of the count of code lines in a directory from all of its files.
